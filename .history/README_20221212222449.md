## Setting up training pipeline

See the [readme from our ICLR 2021 work](https://github.com/ALFA-group/adversarial-code-generation) for details on setting up the basic training pipeline.

## Commands

- Download and normalize datasets
```
make download-datasets
make normalize-datasets
```
- Create the transformed datasets
```
make apply-transforms-sri-py150
make apply-transforms-csn-python
make extract-transformed-tokens
```
- Train a normal seq2seq model for 10 epochs on `sri/py150`
```
bash experiments/normal_seq2seq_train.sh
```
- Run adversarial training and testing on `sri/py150` for 5 epochs
```
bash experiments/normal_adv_train.sh
```
- Get the augmented `csn-python` datasets with random and adversarial views
```
bash scripts/augment.sh
```
- Pretrain a seq2seq encoder on a `csn-python` augmented dataset, finetune the encoder on `sri/py150`, and test the final model on normal and adversarial datasets.
```
bash experiments/finetune_and_test_0.sh
```
- Pretrain a seq2seq encoder on `csn-python` and run adversasrial training starting from the pretrained model.
```
bash experiments/pretrain_adv_train.sh
```
A## Moving docker images away from `/` to a disk

Get docker to use an external disk to write intermediate containers. 

See https://www.guguweb.com/2019/02/07/how-to-move-docker-data-directory-to-another-location-on-ubuntu/ for details. 

Steps involved are
```
- sudo service docker stop
- Using your preferred text editor add a file named daemon.json under the directory /etc/docker. The file should have this content:

{
   "data-root": "/path/to/your/docker"
}
- sudo rsync -aP /var/lib/docker/ /path/to/your/docker
- sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.old
- sudo service docker start
- sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker.old
```
