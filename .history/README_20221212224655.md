## Abstract 
Machine learning (ML) models that learn and predict properties of computer programs are increasingly being adopted and deployed. 
These models have demonstrated success in applications such as auto-completing code, summarizing large programs, and detecting bugs and malware in programs. 
In this work, we investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop first-order optimization algorithms to  efficiently determine two key aspects -- which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to ease optimization. 
We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the problem of program summarization. 
We show that our best attack proposal achieves a  improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation approach for programs trained on a seq2seq model.
We further show that our formulation is better at training models that are robust to adversarial attacks.

## Setting up training pipeline

See the [readme from our ICLR 2021 work](https://github.com/ALFA-group/adversarial-code-generation) for details on setting up the basic training pipeline.

## Commands

- Download and normalize datasets
```
make download-datasets
make normalize-datasets
```
- Create the transformed datasets
```
make apply-transforms-sri-py150

```
bash experiments/normal_adv_train.sh
```
- Get the augmented `sri/py150` datasets with random and adversarial views
```

```


## Directory Structure

The instructions that follow have been adopted from [Ramakrishnan et al.'s codebase](https://github.com/jjhenkel/averloc).
In this repository, we have the following directories:

### `./datasets`

**Note:** the datasets are all much too large to be included in this GitHub repo. This is simply the
structure as it would exist on disk once our framework is setup.

```bash
./datasets
  + ./raw            # The four datasets in "raw" form
  + ./normalized     # The four datasets in the "normalized" JSON-lines representation 
  + ./preprocess
    + ./tokens       # The four datasets in a representation suitable for token-level models
    + ./ast-paths    # The four datasets in a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./transformed    # The four datasets transformed via our code-transformation framework 
    + ./normalized   # Transformed datasets normalized back into the JSON-lines representation
    + ./preprocessed # Transformed datasets preprocessed into:
      + ./tokens     # ... a representation suitable for token-level models
      + ./ast-paths  # ... a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./adversarial    # Datasets in the format < source, target, tranformed-variant #1, #2, ..., #K >
    + ./tokens       # ... in a token-level representation
    + ./ast-paths    # ... in an ast-paths representation
```

## `./models`

We have two Machine Learning on Code models. Both of them are trained on the Code Summarization task. The
seq2seq model has been modified to incorporate our attack formulation, and includes an adversarial training loop.
The branch `pytorch-code2seq` implements our attack formulation on `code2seq`. This is work in progress.

```bash
./models
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq   # seq2seq model implementation
  + ./contracode   # contracode encoder, including transformer encoder and lstm encoder.
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq-code-completion # seq2seq model for code completion
  + ./Transformer # Transformer for code summarization.  
```

## `./results`

This directory stores results that are small-enough to be checked into GitHub. This is automatically generated once the codebase is set up.

## `./scripts`

In this directory there are a large number of scripts for doing various chores related to running and maintaing
this code transformation infrastructure.

## `./tasks`

This directory houses the implementations of various pieces of our core framework:

```bash
./tasks
  + ./astor-apply-transforms
  + ./depth-k-test-seq2seq
  + ./download-c2s-dataset
  + ./download-csn-dataset
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-c2s
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-tokens
  + ./generate-baselines
  + ./integrated-gradients-seq2seq
  + ./normalize-raw-dataset
  + ./preprocess-dataset-c2s
  + ./preprocess-dataset-tokens
  + ./spoon-apply-transforms
  + ./test-model-*
  + ./train-model-*
  + ./pretain-contracode*
  + ./adv-pretrain-controcode*
  + ./adv-train-model-seq2seq-online*
  + ./finetune-contracode*
```

## `./vendor`

This directory contains dependencies in the form of git submodukes.

## `Makefile`

We have one overarching `Makefile` that can be used to drive a number of the data generation, training, testing, adn evaluation tasks.
