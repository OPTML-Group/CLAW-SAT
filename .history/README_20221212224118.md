## Setting up training pipeline

See the [readme from our ICLR 2021 work](https://github.com/ALFA-group/adversarial-code-generation) for details on setting up the basic training pipeline.

## Commands

- Download and normalize datasets
```
make download-datasets
make normalize-datasets
```
- Create the transformed datasets
```
make apply-transforms-sri-py150
make apply-transforms-csn-python
make extract-transformed-tokens
```
- Train a normal seq2seq model for 10 epochs on `sri/py150`
```
bash experiments/normal_seq2seq_train.sh
```
- Run adversarial training and testing on `sri/py150` for 5 epochs
```
bash experiments/normal_adv_train.sh
```
- Get the augmented `sri/py150` datasets with random and adversarial views
```
bash scripts/augment.sh
```
- Pretrain a seq2seq encoder on a `sri/py150` augmented dataset, finetune the encoder on `sri/py150`, and test the final model on normal and adversarial datasets.
```
bash experiments/finetune_and_test_0.sh
```
- Pretrain a seq2seq encoder on `sri/py150` and run adversasrial training starting from the pretrained model.
```
bash experiments/pretrain_adv_train.sh
```


## Directory Structure

The instructions that follow have been adopted from [Ramakrishnan et al.'s codebase](https://github.com/jjhenkel/averloc).
In this repository, we have the following directories:

### `./datasets`

**Note:** the datasets are all much too large to be included in this GitHub repo. This is simply the
structure as it would exist on disk once our framework is setup.

```bash
./datasets
  + ./raw            # The four datasets in "raw" form
  + ./normalized     # The four datasets in the "normalized" JSON-lines representation 
  + ./preprocess
    + ./tokens       # The four datasets in a representation suitable for token-level models
    + ./ast-paths    # The four datasets in a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./transformed    # The four datasets transformed via our code-transformation framework 
    + ./normalized   # Transformed datasets normalized back into the JSON-lines representation
    + ./preprocessed # Transformed datasets preprocessed into:
      + ./tokens     # ... a representation suitable for token-level models
      + ./ast-paths  # ... a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./adversarial    # Datasets in the format < source, target, tranformed-variant #1, #2, ..., #K >
    + ./tokens       # ... in a token-level representation
    + ./ast-paths    # ... in an ast-paths representation
```

## `./models`

We have two Machine Learning on Code models. Both of them are trained on the Code Summarization task. The
seq2seq model has been modified to incorporate our attack formulation, and includes an adversarial training loop.
The branch `pytorch-code2seq` implements our attack formulation on `code2seq`. This is work in progress.

```bash
./models
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq   # seq2seq model implementation
  + ./contracode   # contracode encoder, including transformer encoder and lstm encoder.
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq-code-completion # seq2seq model for code completion
  + ./Transformer # Transformer for code summarization.  
```

## `./results`

This directory stores results that are small-enough to be checked into GitHub. This is automatically generated once the codebase is set up.

## `./scripts`

In this directory there are a large number of scripts for doing various chores related to running and maintaing
this code transformation infrastructure.

## `./tasks`

This directory houses the implementations of various pieces of our core framework:

```bash
./tasks
  + ./astor-apply-transforms
  + ./depth-k-test-seq2seq
  + ./download-c2s-dataset
  + ./download-csn-dataset
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-c2s
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-tokens
  + ./generate-baselines
  + ./integrated-gradients-seq2seq
  + ./normalize-raw-dataset
  + ./preprocess-dataset-c2s
  + ./preprocess-dataset-tokens
  + ./spoon-apply-transforms
  + ./test-model-*
  + ./train-model-*
  + ./pretain-contracode*
  + ./adv-pretrain-controcode*
  + ./adv-train-model-seq2seq-online*
  + ./finetune-contracode*
```

## `./vendor`

This directory contains dependencies in the form of git submodukes.

## `Makefile`

We have one overarching `Makefile` that can be used to drive a number of the data generation, training, testing, adn evaluation tasks.
