## Abstract 
We integrate contrastive learning (CL) with adversarial learning to co-optimize the robustness and accuracy of code models. Different from existing works, we show that code obfuscation, a standard code transformation operation, provides novel means to generate complementary `views' of a code that enable us to achieve both robust and accurate code models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to explore and exploit the robustness and accuracy benefits of (multi-view) code obfuscations in code models. Specifically, we first adopt adversarial codes as robustness-promoting views in CL at the self-supervised pre-training phase. This yields improved robustness and transferability for downstream tasks. Next, at the supervised fine-tuning stage, we show that adversarial training with a proper temporally-staggered schedule of adversarial code generation can further improve robustness and accuracy of the pre-trained code model. Built on the above two modules, we develop CLAWSAT, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for code by integrating CL with adversarial views (CLAW) with staggered a–dversarial t–raining (SAT). On evaluating three downstream tasks across Python and Java, we show that CLAWSAT consistently yields the best robustness and accuracy (e.g. 11% in robustness and 6% in accuracy on the code summarization task in Python). We additionally demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial learning in CLAW by analyzing the characteristics of the loss landscape and interpretability of the pre-trained models.

## Directory Structure

The instructions that follow have been adopted from [Ramakrishnan et al.'s codebase](https://github.com/jjhenkel/averloc).
In this repository, we have the following directories:

### `./datasets`

**Note:** the datasets are all much too large to be included in this GitHub repo. This is simply the
structure as it would exist on disk once our framework is setup.

```bash
./datasets
  + ./raw            # The four datasets in "raw" form
  + ./normalized     # The four datasets in the "normalized" JSON-lines representation 
  + ./preprocess
    + ./tokens       # The four datasets in a representation suitable for token-level models
    + ./ast-paths    # The four datasets in a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./transformed    # The four datasets transformed via our code-transformation framework 
    + ./normalized   # Transformed datasets normalized back into the JSON-lines representation
    + ./preprocessed # Transformed datasets preprocessed into:
      + ./tokens     # ... a representation suitable for token-level models
      + ./ast-paths  # ... a representation suitable for code2seq
  + ./adversarial    # Datasets in the format < source, target, tranformed-variant #1, #2, ..., #K >
    + ./tokens       # ... in a token-level representation
    + ./ast-paths    # ... in an ast-paths representation
```

## `./models`

We have two Machine Learning on Code models. Both of them are trained on the Code Summarization task. The
seq2seq model has been modified to incorporate our attack formulation, and includes an adversarial training loop.
The branch `pytorch-code2seq` implements our attack formulation on `code2seq`. This is work in progress.

```bash
./models
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq   # seq2seq model implementation
  + ./contracode   # contracode encoder, including transformer encoder and lstm encoder.
  + ./pytorch-seq2seq-code-completion # seq2seq model for code completion
  + ./Transformer # Transformer for code summarization.  
```

## `./results`

This directory stores results that are small-enough to be checked into GitHub. This is automatically generated once the codebase is set up.

## `./scripts`

In this directory there are a large number of scripts for doing various chores related to running and maintaing
this code transformation infrastructure.

## `./tasks`

This directory houses the implementations of various pieces of our core framework:

```bash
./tasks
  + ./astor-apply-transforms
  + ./depth-k-test-seq2seq
  + ./download-c2s-dataset
  + ./download-csn-dataset
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-c2s
  + ./extract-adv-dataset-tokens
  + ./generate-baselines
  + ./integrated-gradients-seq2seq
  + ./normalize-raw-dataset
  + ./preprocess-dataset-c2s
  + ./preprocess-dataset-tokens
  + ./spoon-apply-transforms
  + ./test-model-*
  + ./train-model-*
  + ./pretain-contracode*
  + ./adv-pretrain-controcode*
  + ./adv-train-model-seq2seq-online*
  + ./finetune-contracode*
```

## `./vendor`

This directory contains dependencies in the form of git submodukes.

## `Makefile`

We have one overarching `Makefile` that can be used to drive a number of the data generation, training, testing, adn evaluation tasks.
